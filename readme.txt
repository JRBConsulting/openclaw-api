REST API for OpenClaw remote site management with fine-grained capability controls.

== Description ==

OpenClaw API provides a secure REST API for remote management of your WordPress site. 
Designed to work with OpenClaw AI assistants, it enables remote content creation, 
plugin management, and site administration.

**Features:**

* **Content Management** - Create, update, and delete posts, pages, categories, and tags
* **Plugin Management** - Search, install, activate, deactivate, update, and delete plugins
* **Fine-grained Permissions** - Enable only the capabilities you need
* **Token-based Authentication** - Secure API token system (works behind Cloudflare)
* **WordPress.org Integration** - Search and install plugins directly from the repository

**Security:**

* All endpoints require authentication via `X-OpenClaw-Token` header
* Tokens are hashed for secure storage
* Dangerous actions (plugin install, activate, delete) are disabled by default
* Token can be regenerated or deleted at any time
* Works with Cloudflare and other CDNs that strip Authorization headers
* Timing-safe token comparison prevents timing attacks

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `openclaw-api` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings → OpenClaw API
4. Generate an API token
5. Enable the capabilities you need
6. Use the token in your API requests with the `X-OpenClaw-Token` header

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not use the WordPress REST API? =

The standard WordPress REST API uses the Authorization header, which is stripped by 
Cloudflare and some other CDNs. OpenClaw API uses a custom header (`X-OpenClaw-Token`) 
that works reliably behind these services.

= Is this plugin secure? =

Yes. All endpoints require a valid API token. Tokens are hashed using WordPress's 
secure hashing. Dangerous operations are disabled by default and must be explicitly 
enabled in the settings. Tokens can be regenerated or revoked at any time.

= Can I use this with other tools besides OpenClaw? =

Yes! Any tool that can make HTTP requests with custom headers can use this API.

== Usage ==

**Authentication:**

```bash
curl -H "X-OpenClaw-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    https://yoursite.com/wp-json/openclaw/v1/site
```

**List Posts:**

```bash
curl -H "X-OpenClaw-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    https://yoursite.com/wp-json/openclaw/v1/posts
```

**Create a Post:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H "X-OpenClaw-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title":"My Post","content":"Post content","status":"draft"}' \
    https://yoursite.com/wp-json/openclaw/v1/posts
```

**Search Plugins:**

```bash
curl -H "X-OpenClaw-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/openclaw/v1/plugins/search?q=seo"
```

**Install and Activate a Plugin:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H "X-OpenClaw-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"slug":"wordpress-seo","activate":true}' \
    https://yoursite.com/wp-json/openclaw/v1/plugins/install
```
